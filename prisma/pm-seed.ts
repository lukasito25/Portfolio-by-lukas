## Introduction
When you're responsible for products serving 165M+ users, traditional product management approaches break down. Here are the key lessons I've learned about scaling product teams and processes.

## The Scale Challenge
At massive scale, every decision has exponential impact. A 1% improvement in conversion affects 1.65M users. A performance issue can crash revenue. The stakes are high, and traditional approaches don't work.

## Key Principles for Scale

### 1. Infrastructure-First Thinking
Before building features, ensure your infrastructure can handle the load. We learned this the hard way when a viral feature brought down our platform.

### 2. Data-Driven Everything
At scale, intuition fails. Every decision must be backed by data. We implemented real-time analytics across all product metrics.

### 3. Autonomous Teams
Centralized decision-making becomes a bottleneck. Teams need authority to move fast within strategic guardrails.
